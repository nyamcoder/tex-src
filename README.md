tex-src (https://github.com/nyamcoder/tex-src)
==============================================

* contains several subfolders with LaTeX-examples mentioned in my (yet not published) book dealing with LaTeX, Linux, and Korean or Korean localisation, respectively, under the motto "Learn LaTeX through Korean studies." The OS has been Arch Linux, TeX system TeXLive (2008 or later). However, some examples use external programs, TeX packages, fonts, or other data. Hence
		--> the source files may also contain CJK text
		--> most of the examples are in UTF-8
		--> the whole stuff may work on other (up to date) TeX-systems
		--> the whole stuff may work on other Linux distros or OSes
		--> the preferred way for compiling (getting a PDF) is the command line
		--> some external programs should have been installed, before running certain examples
		--> some external fonts or programs (bundled with these fonts) may need a proper license, as I do not provide any of these; alternatively look for other (free) fonts.

* The subfolders contain
		--> one or more .tex or .ltx and maybe other additional source files ready for compilation
		--> a reference PDF
		--> input files when necessary, such as 
				o a pre-processed image file
				o other .tex files.

* Compilation instructions and optional information are provided at the end of each example's main source file.

* I haven't decided yet, if, when and where to publish my book, where all would be explained in detail. Ntl. a brief description and links to other resources are given at my dA-gallery: http://mitoxd.deviantart.com/gallery/ .

* MORE EXAMPLES TO COME!

* I would be pleased, if the material here is of interest for others. Everything is free for private use. Anyhow, in case somebody wants to publish any unmodified material or modified material based on it, you need to ask for my permission and to credit me; please send an e-mail to  < info AT mito-space DOT com > then. Thanks a lot.


Have fun! ^^
